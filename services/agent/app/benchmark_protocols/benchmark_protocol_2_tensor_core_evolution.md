Benchmark Protocol 2: NVIDIA Tensor Core Evolution

Task Statement
"Summarize how NVIDIA Tensor Core instructions evolved from Volta (2017) to Hopper (2022). Keep it short with citations."

Required Deliverables
1. Instruction Evolution
For Volta and Hopper:

Primary instruction name

One supported data type per generation

2 citations total: NVIDIA whitepaper or PTX docs

2. PTX Snapshot
Pick one architecture (Volta or Hopper):

Provide one exact PTX instruction syntax line

One-sentence description of what it does

Cite PTX ISA or CUDA programming manual

3. Minimal Implementation Evidence
Find one official NVIDIA example or library page that mentions Tensor Cores

Provide the page URL and the feature name referenced

Show a short path: "CUDA docs → example/library page"

Success Criteria
3 citations total

Path with 2 steps

Exact instruction syntax present
