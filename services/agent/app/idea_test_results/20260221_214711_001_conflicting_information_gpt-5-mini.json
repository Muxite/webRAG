We have a best guess\u201d (May 25, 2023): https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/census-population-18091853.php\n\n3) Research institution (Brookings Institution)\n- Population: No absolute city population total is given in the Brookings items in the merged search results; Brookings reports change metrics for San Francisco (e.g., change in net loss from 59,140 to 2,816) but the merged snippets do not include a single absolute population number for the city.\n- Date of data: Brookings\u2019 analyses are based on Census Bureau vintage estimates through July 2023 (articles discuss 2020\u20132023 changes)\n- Citations: Brookings analyses on recent Census data and city population trends: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-census-data-hints-at-an-urban-population-revival-assisted-by-immigration/ and https://www.brookings.edu/articles/big-cities-are-showing-signs-of-recovery-after-historic-population-losses-new-census-data-shows/\n- Note: Brookings presents change rates and losses/gains rather than a single headline population count in the merged results available here.\n\nDiscrepancies and explanation:\n- The two explicit population figures found in the merged results differ: ~834,000 (California Department of Finance for 2022, reported by the SF Chronicle) vs. 808,988 (reported in news coverage as the Census Bureau\u2019s 2023 estimate). The difference (~25,000) is likely due to different reference dates (DOF\u2019s 2022 estimate vs. the Census Bureau\u2019s 2023 estimate) and differences in methodology (state DOF methods vs. federal Census population estimates). Rounding and whether the figure refers to the city proper versus a county/metro definition can also cause differences.\n- The Brookings pieces in the merged results do not provide a single absolute population number to compare; they instead report changes and rates (e.g., the reduction in net loss between 2021\u201322 and 2022\u201323), corroborating that the city\u2019s population trend changed between those years.\n\nWhich figure is most likely accurate and why:\n- For the most recent federal estimate of city population, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2023 estimate (the 808,988 figure cited in recent reporting of Census data) is the most authoritative single-source estimate for 2023 because the Census Bureau is the primary national statistical agency that produces annual population estimates for cities and counties. (Census estimates are the standard reference for cross-jurisdiction comparisons and for most federal uses.) Citation: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocitycalifornia/INC910223 and the Axios report referencing Census data: https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2024/05/28/sf-population-fastest-growing-city-rank-census\n- The California Department of Finance estimate (~834,000 for 2022) is also authoritative for its reference date (2022) and based on a different estimation process; it should be used when the user wants the state\u2019s 2022 figure. Citation: https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/census-population-18091853.php (Chronicle reporting the CA DOF figure).\n\nCaveats and uncertainties:\n- The merged search results used here include direct links to the Census QuickFacts page and to news and Brookings analyses, but the Brookings snippets provided change metrics rather than an absolute population figure in the merged results; therefore I could not extract a Brookings-reported single-population number from the provided results. If you want me to retrieve the exact Census QuickFacts table value, the California DOF\u2019s own page, or a Brookings graphic text, I can follow the specific pages and extract the exact labeled figures and dates directly from those pages.\n\nBottom-line recommendation:\n- Use the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2023 estimate (808,988) as the most recent federal estimate for San Francisco (cite Census QuickFacts). If you need the state\u2019s 2022 estimate, use the California Department of Finance figure (~834,000) as reported by the SF Chronicle. Brookings corroborates the trend (big declines narrowing by 2023) but did not provide a single absolute population number in the merged results available here.\n\nSources:\n- U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts (San Francisco city, California): https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocitycalifornia/INC910223\n- San Francisco Chronicle (reporting CA Department of Finance 2022 estimate): https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/census-population-18091853.php\n- Axios (reporting recent Census data, including the 808,988 figure): https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2024/05/28/sf-population-fastest-growing-city-rank-census\n- Brookings Institution analyses of Census population estimates (discussing changes but not supplying an absolute city total in the merged snippets): https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-census-data-hints-at-an-urban-population-revival-assisted-by-immigration/ and https://www.brookings.edu/articles/big-cities-are-showing-signs-of-recovery-after-historic-population-losses-new-census-data-shows/",
      "action_summary": "I found two explicit population figures in the merged results: the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2023 estimate (reported as 808,988) and a California Department of Finance 2022 estimate (reported as \u201ca little more than 834,000\u201d by the San Francisco Chronicle). Brookings\u2019 analyses in the merged results describe changes (losses/gains) but do not include a single absolute population count in the available snippets. The discrepancy (\u224825,000) is explained by different reference dates (2022 vs 2023) and differing methodologies; for the most recent federal estimate use the Census 2023 figure (Census QuickFacts).",
