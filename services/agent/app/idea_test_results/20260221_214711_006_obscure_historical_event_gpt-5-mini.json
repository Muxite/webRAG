The two task nodes show that searches and plans were executed (search terms, target repositories, and steps), but the merged results do not include the actual primary-source documents, scanned newspaper pages, quotations, or specific URLs. Because your instruction requires using only evidence from searches/visits and to avoid guessing, I cannot fabricate quotes or supply URLs that were not returned in the material you merged. \n\nWhat is present in the merged material (summary of actions performed):\n- Intended primary-source repositories and targets: Trove (National Library of Australia digitised newspapers), National Archives of Australia, state library digital collections, Hansard (parliamentary records), and contemporary 1932 newspapers.\n- Search queries used (examples recorded in the task nodes): queries for \"Great Emu War 1932 newspaper site:trove.nla.gov.au\", \"emu campaign 1932 'machine guns' 'soldiers' 'Campion' 'Wyalong' 'Swan' site:trove.nla.gov.au\", and parliamentary/Hansard queries.\n- Plan to extract verbatim quotes and capture full bibliographic metadata (publication, date, page, URL).\n\nWhat is missing and why I cannot complete the requested deliverable yet:\n- The merged results do not include any captured primary-source text, verbatim quotations, bibliographic metadata, or the URLs of the scanned newspapers or archive items. The nodes record search activity and intended next steps but do not contain the actual documents or links. Per your instruction to use only evidence from searches/visits and to state explicitly when evidence is missing, I must report that the necessary source texts and URLs are absent from the provided data. Therefore I cannot quote a 1932 passage or provide usable source URLs from the merged content.\n\nOptions I can take next (please choose one):\n1) Run live searches and fetch sources now: I will search Trove, the National Archives of Australia, Australian War Memorial, state library collections, and reputable modern analyses (ABC, BBC, scholarly articles), extract at least one verbatim 1932 quotation with full citation, and return a consolidated list of URLs and short summaries. (I will cite each URL inline.)\n2) If you prefer to supply the raw search results or URLs you already have, I will extract verbatim quotations and assemble the bibliography and analysis from those items.\n3) I can prepare a detailed search plan (exact queries, likely newspapers and date ranges, and step-by-step retrieval instructions) that you or I can run later.\n\nRecommended targets I will search if you choose option 1 (these are the repositories recorded as the planned targets in your merged results):\n- Trove (National Library of Australia) digitised newspapers for 1932 contemporaneous accounts\n- National Archives of Australia (records for 1932 Western Australia agricultural/military correspondence)\n- Australian War Memorial / state libraries (Western Australia) for government or military reports\n- Hansard / parliamentary questions in 1932 regarding emus/farmers\n- Reputable modern analyses: Australian War Memorial pages, ABC News retrospectives, academic articles, and museum or library essays\n\nPlease tell me which option you want. If you choose live searching (option 1), I will proceed now and return a deliverable that includes: (a) at least one verbatim 1932 quote with full citation and URL, (b) a list of primary-source URLs and metadata, and (c) modern scholarly/reputable secondary sources with URLs and short summaries.",
