      "final_deliverable": "Status: Cannot complete the requested integrated, fully-cited analysis yet \u2014 missing source evidence.\n\nWhat I checked:\n- You supplied two merged task nodes that show the research and synthesis steps were \"done\" (nodes 121699c9... and e6d9e574...), but neither node contains the actual authoritative source lists, summaries, or the collected citations required to support the cross-domain synthesis. The merged data includes the tasks, requirements, and deliverables, but not the concrete source material or extracted evidence (citations, summaries, or claims) needed to satisfy your mandate.\n\nWhy I cannot proceed as-is:\n- Your mandate requires that every key claim be traceable to at least one authoritative source and that each domain include at least two authoritative sources. The merged items do not contain those sources or their summaries. I must not guess or invent citations; doing so would violate your instruction to use only evidence from searches/visits and the developer instruction to explicitly state missing evidence.\n\nWhat I propose (pick one or more):\n1) I will perform the required evidence-gathering step now and then produce the full integrated report exactly to your specification. This will include: for each of the five domains, gathering at least two authoritative sources (peer-reviewed papers, NIST/IPCC/etc. reports, company whitepapers), extracting 3\u20136 sentence summaries and 2\u20134 key points per source, and then producing the cross-domain synthesis with inline citations and an appended references section. Estimated turnaround: 2\u20133 business days for thorough collection and synthesis; faster (24\u201348 hours) if you accept a more concise report.\n\n2) If you already have the authoritative sources collected elsewhere, you can provide those source lists (PDFs or URLs). I will use them to produce the integrated report and will ensure every claim is traceable to the provided sources. Estimated turnaround: 24\u201348 hours after I receive the sources.\n\n3) If you prefer a high-level conceptual synthesis produced from my general knowledge (without traceable, new external citations), I can draft that immediately. Note: this will not meet your requirement that each claim be backed by the collected domain materials and will not include the appended authoritative-source appendix you requested.\n\nMinimum next actions I need from you to proceed:\n- Confirm which of the three options above you want (1 = I gather sources and do full report; 2 = you supply sources; 3 = high-level non-cited synthesis).\n- If you choose option 1, confirm I may fetch web sources now. If there are specific preferred authorities (e.g., NIST PQC outputs, IPCC AR6, IBM/Google quantum whitepapers, Nature/Science reviews) tell me which to prioritize.\n\nIf you choose option 1, I will return a package in the requested format (structured report, executive summary, domain interconnections, conflicts & synergies, scenarios & timelines, prioritized recommendations) and an appendix listing at least two authoritative sources per domain with citations and URLs. I will ensure every substantive claim is traceable to at least one cited source.\n\nIf you want me to start immediately, reply: \"Proceed to gather sources now\" (option 1) or paste/attach your source list (option 2) or request the uncited high-level draft (option 3).",
