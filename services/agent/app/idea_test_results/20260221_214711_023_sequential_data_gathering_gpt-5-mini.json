It shows different instructions depending on OS.\n\n4) Installation method for my (detected) operating system\n- The install page detected a Unix-like environment (macOS, Linux, WSL) and recommends running this command in a terminal to download rustup and install Rust:\n  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n  [installation instruction source: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/].\n\n- For Windows, the page provides downloadable rustup-init.exe installers (32-bit, x64, ARM64) and instructs to download and run rustup-init.exe, then follow the on-screen instructions; Windows users may also need Visual Studio MSVC build tools [source: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/].\n\n5) Additional notes from official sources\n- rustup manages Rust toolchains (stable/beta/nightly) and is the recommended installer; rustup documentation is available at https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/ and the rustup installer site is https://rustup.rs/ [sources: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/, https://rustup.rs/, https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/].\n- To uninstall: rustup self uninstall (documented on the install page) [source: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/].\n- If PATH-related issues occur after install, the install page documents where tools are placed (~/.cargo/bin or %USERPROFILE%\\.cargo\\bin) and suggests ensuring that directory is on PATH [source: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/].\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Show the exact terminal session to verify rustc --version after installation, or\n- Provide the Windows rustup-init.exe download links from the install page, or\n- Open the rustup installation docs for Windows-specific MSVC instructions (https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html).",

See\nMSVC prerequistes\nFor further information about configuring Rust on Windows see the\nWindows-specific\nrustup\ndocumentation\n.\nToolchain management with\nrustup\nRust is installed and managed by the\nrustup\ntool. Rust has a 6-week\nrapid release process\nand supports a\ngreat\n  number of platforms\n, so there are many builds of Rust available at\n  any time.\nrustup\nmanages these builds in a consistent way\n  on every platform that Rust supports, enabling installation of Rust\n  from the beta and nightly release channels as well as support for\n  additional cross-compilation targets.\nIf you've installed\nrustup\nin the past, you can update\n  your installation by running\nrustup update\n.\nFor more information see the\nrustup\ndocumentation\n.\nConfiguring the\nPATH\nenvironment\nvariable\nIn the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the\n~/.cargo/bin\n%USERPROFILE%\\.cargo\\bin\ndirectory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain,\n  including\nrustc\n,\ncargo\n, and\nrustup\n.\nAccordingly, it is customary for Rust developers to include this\n  directory in their\nPATH\nenvironment variable\n. During installation\nrustup\nwill attempt to configure the\nPATH\n.\n  Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in\nrustup\n, the modifications to\nPATH\nmay not\n  take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out,\n  or it may not succeed at all.\nIf, after installation, running\nrustc --version\nin the\n  console fails, this is the most likely reason.\nUninstall Rust\nIf at any point you would like to uninstall Rust, you can run\nrustup self uninstall\n.\n  We'll miss you though!\nOther installation methods\nThe installation described above, via\nrustup\n, is the preferred way to install Rust for most\ndevelopers. However, Rust can be installed via other methods as well.\nLearn more\nGet help!\nDocumentation\nRust Forge (Contributor Documentation)\nAsk a Question on the Users Forum\nLanguage\nEnglish (en-US)\nEspa\u00f1ol (es)\nFran\u00e7ais (fr)\nItaliano (it)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (ja)\nPortugu\u00eas (pt-BR)\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (ru)\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e (tr)\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (zh-CN)\n\u6b63\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (zh-TW)\nTerms and policies\nCode of Conduct\nLicenses\nLogo Policy and Media Guide\nSecurity Disclosures\nPrivacy Notice\nAll Policies\nSocial\nMaintained by the Rust Team.

See\nMSVC prerequistes\nFor further information about configuring Rust on Windows see the\nWindows-specific\nrustup\ndocumentation\n.\nToolchain management with\nrustup\nRust is installed and managed by the\nrustup\ntool. Rust has a 6-week\nrapid release process\nand supports a\ngreat\n  number of platforms\n, so there are many builds of Rust available at\n  any time.\nrustup\nmanages these builds in a consistent way\n  on every platform that Rust supports, enabling installation of Rust\n  from the beta and nightly release channels as well as support for\n  additional cross-compilation targets.\nIf you've installed\nrustup\nin the past, you can update\n  your installation by running\nrustup update\n.\nFor more information see the\nrustup\ndocumentation\n.\nConfiguring the\nPATH\nenvironment\nvariable\nIn the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the\n~/.cargo/bin\n%USERPROFILE%\\.cargo\\bin\ndirectory, and this is where you will find the Rust toolchain,\n  including\nrustc\n,\ncargo\n, and\nrustup\n.\nAccordingly, it is customary for Rust developers to include this\n  directory in their\nPATH\nenvironment variable\n. During installation\nrustup\nwill attempt to configure the\nPATH\n.\n  Because of differences between platforms, command shells, and bugs in\nrustup\n, the modifications to\nPATH\nmay not\n  take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is logged out,\n  or it may not succeed at all.\nIf, after installation, running\nrustc --version\nin the\n  console fails, this is the most likely reason.\nUninstall Rust\nIf at any point you would like to uninstall Rust, you can run\nrustup self uninstall\n.\n  We'll miss you though!\nOther installation methods\nThe installation described above, via\nrustup\n, is the preferred way to install Rust for most\ndevelopers. However, Rust can be installed via other methods as well.\nLearn more\nGet help!\nDocumentation\nRust Forge (Contributor Documentation)\nAsk a Question on the Users Forum\nLanguage\nEnglish (en-US)\nEspa\u00f1ol (es)\nFran\u00e7ais (fr)\nItaliano (it)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (ja)\nPortugu\u00eas (pt-BR)\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (ru)\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e (tr)\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (zh-CN)\n\u6b63\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (zh-TW)\nTerms and policies\nCode of Conduct\nLicenses\nLogo Policy and Media Guide\nSecurity Disclosures\nPrivacy Notice\nAll Policies\nSocial\nMaintained by the Rust Team.
