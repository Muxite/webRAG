      "final_deliverable": "I searched the government, news, and research-institution sources included in the merged results and report what the available search evidence shows (I have included direct URLs). Where a precise population number/date was not captured in the search results I was given, I state that explicitly rather than guessing.\n\n1) Government (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts)\n- Population figure: Not available in the merged search snippets I was given. The QuickFacts page for San Francisco city / San Francisco County is the authoritative government source for population estimates; however the exact population value and reference date were not captured in the search results text available to me. I cannot state the Census Bureau figure without visiting that QuickFacts page.\n- Date of the data: Not captured in the search snippets I received (QuickFacts pages normally show the population estimate reference date, e.g., July 1 of a given year). \n- Direct citation URL: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocitycalifornia/BZA110222\n\n(If you want the exact Census Bureau number and date I should open that QuickFacts page and extract the value.)\n\n2) News outlet (San Francisco Chronicle)\n- Population figure: 837,165\n- Date of the data: \"this summer\" (the Chronicle article reports this as the city population for summer 2024 / mid-2024). The article states the city \"lost a net 1,086 people between July 2023 and July 2024,\" and gives 837,165 for the most-recent summer estimate reported in the piece.\n- Direct citation URL: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-population-loss-19993542.php\n\n(Other Chronicle pieces in the merged results cite different figures for earlier reference dates: e.g., ~808,988 for July 2023 and ~834,000 for 2022 per the California Dept. of Finance \u2014 see links below.)\n- Example earlier Chronicle cites: \"808,988 residents as of July 2023\" \u2014 https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-population-exodus-over-18972239.php\n- Example Chronicle citation of CA Dept. of Finance for 2022 (~834,000) \u2014 https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/census-population-18091853.php\n\n3) Research institution (Brookings Institution)\n- Population figure: Not provided in the merged search snippets I was given as an absolute number. The Brookings piece in the merged results reports percentage changes and notes San Francisco\u2019s recent percent changes (for example, a 1% increase in 2023-24 relative to the prior period) but the merged snippet does not include an absolute population count.\n- Date of the data: The Brookings analysis refers to the Census Bureau population-estimates period (e.g., 2023-24) in its discussion, but an absolute reference population was not captured in the search snippet I was given.\n- Direct citation URL: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recent-immigration-brought-a-population-rebound-to-americas-major-metro-areas-new-census-data-show/\n\nComparison, discrepancies, and likely-accurate figure\n- Discrepancies visible in the merged search results come mainly from different reference dates and revisions: the Chronicle\u2019s articles cite ~834,000 for 2022 (citing California Dept. of Finance), ~808,988 for July 2023 (citing Census data in that piece), and ~837,165 for summer 2024 (newer Chronicle piece). Brookings reports percent changes (e.g., a ~1% increase in 2023-24) but the merged snippet did not include an absolute population value. The Census QuickFacts page (the authoritative government source) is available in the search results but the exact population number and its reference date were not captured in the search snippet available to me.\n- Why these discrepancies occur: different sources cite different reference dates (calendar-year vs. mid-year estimates), different datasets (California Department of Finance vs. U.S. Census Population Estimates Program), and some news pieces report the Census Bureau\u2019s revised estimates while others report state figures or earlier estimates. Revisions and differing methodologies (state DOF vs. federal Census estimates) commonly cause small differences.\n- Which figure is most likely accurate: the U.S. Census Bureau population estimates (as published on Census.gov/QuickFacts or the Census Population Estimates Program) are generally the most authoritative single-source nationwide estimates; state departments of finance (e.g., California Department of Finance) are also authoritative but may use different methods or revision timing. Because I could not extract the Census QuickFacts population number/date from the merged search results text I was given, I cannot state the exact Census figure here \u2014 but I would consider the Census Bureau\u2019s most-recent estimate (QuickFacts or the Population Estimates Program) the best single figure to use if you need one authoritative number.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can now open the Census QuickFacts page and the Brookings article to extract the exact Census population estimate (number and reference date) and the absolute population number Brookings may cite from its downloadable table. If you want that, say \"Yes \u2014 fetch the Census and Brookings pages\" and I\u2019ll retrieve the precise figures and return an updated answer with all three numbers, dates, and direct citations.",

The Brookings research piece (https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recent-immigration-brought-a-population-rebound-to-americas-major-metro-areas-new-census-data-show/) reports percent changes (e.g., +1% in 2023-24) but the merged snippet did not include an absolute population count.
