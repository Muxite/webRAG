      "action_summary": "Summary / brief comparative synthesis (based only on the available search-result snippets above; full-text evidence unavailable due to failed page visits):\n\n- Common themes across the found documents: a strong emphasis on the difference between transparency and interpretability, interest in making black-box models (especially deep learning and LLMs) more understandable, and ongoing development of attribution methods that link model behavior to inputs, data, or internal components (see https://arxiv.org/html/2501.18887v3 and https://arxiv.org/html/2504.00125v1). Several pieces appear to be surveys or comprehensive perspectives covering the ML workflow and AutoML interpretability challenges (https://arxiv.org/html/2508.11529v1, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07005).\n\n- Methodological directions implied by the snippets: (1) survey/position papers synthesizing XAI advances and trends; (2) attempts to unify attribution across inputs, data, and mechanisms; (3) proposals for interpretable or neurosymbolic frameworks (ICLR entry) and use of LLMs for interpretability; (4) discussions about trustworthiness in high-stakes domains (medical diagnostics) arguing for interpretability even when accuracy is high (https://arxiv.org/html/2507.23535v1).\n\n- Contrasts suggested by the snippets: some works focus on theoretical/terminology clarity (interpretability vs. explainability), others on practical frameworks (neurosymbolic / LLM-based interpretable programs), and others present broad surveys highlighting open problems like making AutoML outputs interpretable.\n\nCaveat: this synthesis is constrained by the fact that full-page visits failed, so I used only the search-result titles and snippets as evidence. I did not extract or assert authors, publication years, or detailed findings because those require successful page fetches. If you want full metadata and accurate main contributions, I can retry fetching the pages and extract the requested fields (title, at least one author, year, main contribution) for at least two documents as you required.",
