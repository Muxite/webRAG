You asked for a comprehensive analysis across five domains with at least two authoritative sources per domain and inline URL citations. I do not have browsing enabled here, so I cannot perform the searches/visits required to supply the mandated citations. Please choose one of the options below so I can continue:\n\nOption A \u2014 Proceed now using my internal knowledge (cutoff 2024-06): I will produce a detailed, fully written synthesis covering: (1) quantum computing principles and current capabilities, (2) cryptography and encryption methods (including post-quantum topics), (3) climate change impacts on computing infrastructure, (4) economic implications of quantum adoption, and (5) ethical considerations of quantum supremacy. I will reference canonical documents and well-known reports by author/title (but I will NOT be able to include live inline URL citations). I will clearly label where my knowledge may be out-of-date and list specific authoritative sources you can ask me to fetch or verify.\n\nOption B \u2014 Allow me to browse (recommended for your citation requirement): Grant permission or provide the authoritative documents/URLs you want included (or allow me to perform web searches). I will retrieve at least two authoritative sources per domain, include inline URL citations for each claim, and then deliver the requested cross-domain synthesis with explicit evidentiary support.\n\nOption C \u2014 You supply the sources: Provide the URLs (minimum two per domain). I will synthesize those sources into the requested analysis and include inline citations to the URLs you provide.\n\nIf you choose Option A, I will proceed immediately. If you choose Option B or C, please confirm and I will fetch and cite the sources and return the full analysis.\n\nPlanned structure of the deliverable (if you permit me to proceed):\n1) Executive summary (high-level interconnection and key takeaways)\n2) Domain writeups (each domain: state-of-the-art, authoritative evidence, key trends)\n   - Quantum computing (principles, NISQ, fault tolerance, leading platforms, demonstrated capabilities)\n   - Cryptography (symmetric/asymmetric, quantum threats, post-quantum cryptography standards)\n   - Climate impacts (data center energy trends, climate risks to infrastructure, resilience measures)\n   - Economics (market projections, industry adoption pathways, disruption scenarios, workforce impacts)\n   - Ethics (dual-use, security, equity, governance)\n3) Cross-domain synthesis (how domains interact; synergies and conflicts)\n4) Scenarios and future landscape (short, medium, long term) with policy/business/technical recommendations\n5) Appendix: recommended authoritative sources (2+ per domain) and gaps/uncertainties\n\nIf you want me to proceed now with Option A (internal knowledge) say \u201cProceed with internal synthesis.\u201d If you prefer Option B, say \u201cEnable browsing\u201d or paste the sources for Option C.\n\nNote: Because your instructions require inline URLs and explicit sourcing, I recommend Option B or C so the final product meets your evidence requirement.",
      "action_summary": "I cannot perform live web searches in this session, so I cannot supply the required inline URL citations. Choose one: (A) I deliver a detailed synthesis based on knowledge up to 2024-06 but without live URL citations; (B) allow web access so I can fetch and cite at least two authoritative sources per domain; or (C) provide the URLs you want used and I will synthesize them with inline citations. I included a proposed structure and next steps; confirm which option you want so I can produce the full, sourced analysis.",
