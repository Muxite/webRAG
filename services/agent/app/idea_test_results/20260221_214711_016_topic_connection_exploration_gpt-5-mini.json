      "final_deliverable": "Exploration record (from the available search results)\n\n1) Start: locate the Wikipedia page for \"Machine learning\"\n- Action/result: I ran a search and found the canonical page: \"Machine learning - Wikipedia\" (search result). URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\n- Why chosen: This is the required start point for the exploration.\n- Evidence (search result excerpt): \"Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data...\" [search result for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning]\n\n2) From the search results, identify pages that likely connect Machine Learning to Neuroscience\n- Candidate: \"Neural network (machine learning) - Wikipedia\". URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)\n  - Why chosen: The search-result description explicitly states the tie to biology: \"...a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks.\" This directly connects ML concepts to neuroscience concepts (biological neural networks).\n  - Evidence (search result excerpt): \"In machine learning, a neural network (NN) or neural net, also called an artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks...\" [search result for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)]\n\n- Other search results found (less directly relevant but noted):\n  - \"Active learning (machine learning)\" \u2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning) (found in the same search results; describes an ML paradigm involving interactive querying)\n  - \"Online machine learning\" \u2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning (found in search results; describes a learning paradigm with sequential data)\n  - \"Outline of machine learning\" \u2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_machine_learning (overview page)\n  - Why noted: These pages were returned by the search and help map the ML landscape, but their search-result descriptions do not themselves state a neuroscience connection the way the Neural network page does.\n\n3) Attempts to open/follow links from the Machine learning page\n- Action: I attempted to fetch and follow links from the Machine learning page (to open its linked pages such as \"Artificial neural network\", \"Computational neuroscience\", \"Brain\u2013computer interface\", \"Neuroinformatics\").\n- Result: HTTP fetch attempts failed (runtime fetch errors). I could not retrieve the full Machine learning page or the full content of the linked pages during this session. Therefore I could not capture page text beyond the search-result descriptions. (Errors reported: \"HTTP fetch failed: URL returned by the previous search for the Wikipedia 'Machine learning' page status=None\" and similar for the linked pages.)\n\n4) How each link choice related to finding the connection\n- Machine learning page: chosen as the mandated start point.\n- Neural network (machine learning) page: chosen because its description explicitly names biological neural networks as the inspiration for ML neural networks\u2014this is direct evidence of conceptual overlap between machine learning and neuroscience. URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)\n- Other ML pages found in the search (Active learning, Online machine learning, Outline): chosen to map out ML subareas; none of their search-result snippets explicitly mention neuroscience, so they were lower priority for establishing the ML\u2194Neuroscience connection.\n\n5) Identified connecting concept(s) (evidence-based)\n- Primary connecting concept (supported by available evidence): Artificial neural networks (ANNs) / neural networks. The search-result text for the Neural network (machine learning) page explicitly states that ANNs are \"a computational model inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks,\" which ties machine-learning models to neuroscience concepts (biological neural networks). Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)\n\n6) Missing evidence and next steps\n- Missing evidence: I was unable to fetch the full Machine learning Wikipedia page and the full content of linked pages due to HTTP fetch failures, so I could not extract additional supporting text (for example, from pages like \"Computational neuroscience,\" \"Brain\u2013computer interface,\" or the full Machine learning article) that would further document other specific connections (computational neuroscience, brain\u2013computer interfaces, neuroinformatics, etc.). The errors encountered are documented in the exploration results.\n- Recommended next steps (to complete the exploration): open the Machine learning page and follow its in-article links for \"Artificial neural network,\" \"Computational neuroscience,\" and \"Brain\u2013computer interface,\" and capture their opening paragraphs or relevant sentences to show more explicit ties.\n\nConcise conclusion (evidence-based): From the available search results, the clearest documented connection between Machine Learning and Neuroscience is artificial neural networks: the ML concept of a neural network is explicitly described as being inspired by the structure and functions of biological neural networks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)). The full Machine learning article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and related pages likely contain further connections (computational neuroscience, brain\u2013computer interfaces), but I could not fetch their full contents in this session and therefore cannot quote or cite them beyond the search-result snippets already shown.",
