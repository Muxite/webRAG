      "final_deliverable": "I reviewed the merged research nodes you supplied. Both nodes describe an archival research plan (searches on Trove, the National Archives of Australia, and the Australian War Memorial, and the goal of extracting verbatim quotes and scanned pages). However, the merged results do NOT include the actual primary-source URLs, file identifiers, scanned-page links, or any verbatim quoted passage from a 1932\u20131933 contemporary source. Because those concrete items (URLs and quoted passages) are missing from the evidence you provided, I cannot in good faith invent or guess them.\n\nWhat I can say from the merged-results evidence (what was recorded in the nodes):\n- Repositories targeted: Trove (National Library of Australia newspapers), National Archives of Australia (Defence/Department files), and the Australian War Memorial collections. The nodes indicate scanned newspapers and official files were sought for late 1932\u2013early 1933 coverage of emu-related operations in Western Australia.\n- Expected primary-source types: contemporary newspaper articles (scanned pages), military reports/dispatches, government correspondence, photographs, and farmer letters/diaries. The nodes describe extracting at least one verbatim quote from a contemporary article or official document.\n- Expected secondary sources: modern academic and reputable popular analyses (books, journal articles, museum summaries) to contextualize the events.\n\nWhat is missing from the merged results (so I cannot provide them):\n- Direct URLs to specific Trove newspaper scans or pages about the 1932 emu operations.\n- National Archives of Australia file references or direct links to digitized Defence files concerning emus or military assistance in Western Australia (1932) with file numbers.\n- Australian War Memorial item IDs/URLs for photos or unit reports referencing the emu operations.\n- Any verbatim quotation from a contemporary 1932\u20131933 newspaper or official document (the merged nodes describe extracting quotes but do not include the quoted text or its source citation).\n\nNext steps I can perform if you want me to proceed now (I will retrieve and provide concrete evidence, URLs, and at least one quoted passage):\n1) Search Trove (National Library of Australia) for 1932\u20131933 newspaper coverage using targeted queries such as: \"emu\" + \"Campion\" OR \"Merredin\" OR \"Serpentine\" OR \"army\" and retrieve scanned-page URLs and transcribe a verbatim passage with citation (newspaper title, date, page/column).  \n2) Search the National Archives of Australia (RecordSearch) for Defence files (1932) mentioning emus or military assistance to farmers in Western Australia; capture file IDs and direct URLs to digitized records or provide instructions to request copies if not digitized.  \n3) Search the Australian War Memorial collection for photographs, unit logs, or correspondence mentioning emu operations and provide item IDs and URLs.  \n4) Collect modern analyses (scholarly articles, book chapters, museum pages) and provide URLs and short annotations for each.\n\nIf you want me to proceed, confirm and I will run the live searches and return:  \n- An annotated bibliography (primary and secondary sources),  \n- Direct URLs to every source, and  \n- At least one verbatim quote from a 1932\u20131933 contemporary newspaper or official document with full citation.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also target specific newspapers first (for example: The West Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Daily News (Perth), or regional Western Australian papers) \u2014 tell me which you prefer.\n\nBecause the merged nodes you provided lack the required concrete URLs and quoted passages, I cannot supply those items until I perform the retrieval step. Please confirm that you want me to run the live searches now.",
