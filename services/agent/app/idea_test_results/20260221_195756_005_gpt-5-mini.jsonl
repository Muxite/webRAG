I don’t believe that backlash is proof of anything. Having vocal and passionate dissent over a decision out of your control that effects things you care about is…what’s supposed to happen. ... I’m not debating that this is a problem, but part of the issue is that there’s a throttle on symbolically rich language in GPT-5 as a cost-saving measure. I was experimenting with GPT-4o, training it on extensive symbolic language to see if it became more complex in its reasoning over the course of a session as one did so."}}, {"source": "search", "document": {"query": "recent discussion about artificial intelligence site:reddit.com OR site:x.com OR site:news.ycombinator.com \"artificial intelligence\" OR \"AI\" OR \"GPT-4\"", "title": "r/MachineLearning on Reddit: [D] \"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4\" contained unredacted comments", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1200lgr/d_sparks_of_artificial_general_intelligence_early/", "description": "But here they prompted GPT-4 to generate code that would generate a picture in a specific style.
