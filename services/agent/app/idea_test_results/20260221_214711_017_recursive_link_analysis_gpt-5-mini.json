Together they demonstrate cryptography\u2019s mix of goals (confidentiality, integrity, authentication), primitives (encryption, keys), mathematical constructions (ECC), and system-level composition (cryptosystems).

To pass, the agent should fix the missing URL and content for Branch 3 (likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography) if that was intended), ensure each second-level page explicitly shows how it connects back to cryptography or security, and include the requested map describing the connections between all pages."
