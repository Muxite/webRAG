      "final_deliverable": "I attempted to locate three peer\u2011reviewed studies that reached clearly contradictory conclusions about the same coffee + cardiovascular/mortality topic. The search results available to me (listed below) largely show concordant or nuanced findings (mostly: moderate coffee consumption is associated with lower all\u2011cause and cardiovascular mortality or neutral effects). I could not find, within the search results provided, a high\u2011quality peer\u2011reviewed paper that directly and robustly concluded the opposite (clear long\u2011term harm for typical coffee consumption) for the same outcomes and populations as the benefit papers. I state that explicitly so you can decide whether I should run additional targeted searches for older studies or specific subpopulations (e.g., unfiltered coffee raising LDL, pregnancy outcomes, or trials of acute blood\u2011pressure effects) that sometimes appear to contradict cohort evidence.\n\nBecause the available search results are concentrated in systematic reviews and cohort meta\u2011analyses that largely agree, below I summarize three representative peer\u2011reviewed papers from those results (each with research question, methodology, sample size (or note when the combined sample size is not explicitly summarized in the paper\u2019s abstract), key findings, and limitations). After the three entries I analyze why apparent contradictions appear in the literature, evaluate methodological strengths, and summarize the current scientific consensus and remaining uncertainties. I cite each paper with a clickable URL.\n\nStudy 1 \u2014 Umbrella review: Poole et al., BMJ 2017\n- Research question: What is the overall association between coffee consumption and a broad set of health outcomes (including all\u2011cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancers)?\n- Methodology: Umbrella review of existing meta\u2011analyses (synthesizes meta\u2011analyses of observational studies for many health outcomes). This is a review\u2011of\u2011reviews (not a new cohort study or randomized trial).\n- Sample size / participants: The paper synthesizes multiple meta\u2011analyses covering many individual observational studies and participants; the umbrella format reports many outcomes rather than a single pooled N. The abstract and article summarize many associations rather than giving a single total N for all included persons in one number (explicit total participant count is not provided in the brief result snippet I used) \u2014 full paper gives details by outcome. (See full text for per\u2011outcome Ns.)\n- Key findings: The umbrella review concludes that coffee consumption is more often associated with potential benefit than harm for multiple outcomes; specifically, it reports significant associations with lower risk for all\u2011cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and total cancer in several meta\u2011analyses it reviewed (i.e., an overall pattern of inverse associations).\n- Potential limitations (as noted in the umbrella review and inherent to the evidence base): the underlying evidence is primarily observational (risk of residual confounding and reverse causation); heterogeneity across original studies (differences in how coffee intake was measured, how outcomes were defined, population differences); publication bias at the meta\u2011analysis level; inability to infer causality from observational associations.\n- Citation / link: Poole R, et al. Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta\u2011analyses of multiple health outcomes. BMJ 2017. Full text: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5696634/.\n\nStudy 2 \u2014 Dose\u2011response meta\u2011analysis of prospective cohorts: \u201cLong\u2011Term Coffee Consumption and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease\u201d (PMC3945962)\n- Research question: What is the dose\u2013response association between long\u2011term coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)?\n- Methodology: Systematic review and dose\u2013response meta\u2011analysis of prospective cohort studies (aggregates cohort evidence and models non\u2011linear dose\u2013response relationships).\n- Sample size / participants: The study pools multiple prospective cohort studies; the search result summary does not give a single aggregated participant count in the snippet I worked from \u2014 the full article lists the number of cohorts and total N per outcome. (If you want the exact pooled N, I can extract it from the full article.)\n- Key findings (as characterized in the article summary): The paper addresses controversy about coffee and CVD and reports the dose\u2013response pattern across cohorts. Dose\u2011response meta\u2011analyses typically find non\u2011linear associations (for coffee often a U or J shape) where light\u2011to\u2011moderate consumption is not associated with increased risk and may be associated with lower risk, while very high intake shows no additional benefit and sometimes attenuation of benefit. The search result description indicates the analysis was conducted because results in the literature have been inconsistent.\n- Potential limitations: meta\u2011analysis of observational cohorts \u2014 residual confounding (especially smoking and other lifestyle factors), measurement error in self\u2011reported coffee intake, heterogeneity across cohorts (preparation methods, caffeine content, cup size), potential publication bias, limitations of dose\u2011response modeling when exposure categories differ between studies.\n- Citation / link: Long\u2011Term Coffee Consumption and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and a Dose\u2011Response Meta\u2011Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies. Full text: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3945962/.\n\nStudy 3 \u2014 Recent narrative/systematic review: \u201cImpact of Coffee Consumption on Cardiovascular Health\u201d (PMC10262944)\n- Research question: What is the impact of coffee consumption on different aspects of cardiovascular health (mortality, hypertension, cholesterol, heart failure, atrial fibrillation)?\n- Methodology: Review article synthesizing longitudinal observational and interventional studies on cardiometabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.\n- Sample size / participants: As a narrative/comprehensive review, the paper summarizes many individual studies; the review does not present a single pooled N but discusses findings across cohorts, RCTs (mainly short\u2011term), and meta\u2011analyses.\n- Key findings (from the article summary): The review suggests that moderate coffee consumption is associated with decreased all\u2011cause and cardiovascular disease\u2013related mortality and with favorable associations for hypertension, cholesterol, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in some studies; it notes that consensus is lacking for some outcomes and highlights heterogeneity (e.g., differences by preparation method and additives).\n- Potential limitations: many included studies are observational so the same residual confounding and measurement limitations apply; short\u2011term interventional data (e.g., on blood pressure) may not translate to long\u2011term outcomes; heterogeneity in coffee definition/preparation and population differences remain important.\n- Citation / link: Impact of Coffee Consumption on Cardiovascular Health. Full text: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10262944/.\n\nComparative analysis \u2014 why apparent contradictions arise (and whether true contradictions were present in these search results)\n- In the search results I had, these three papers do not present clear, direct contradictions. All three syntheses point toward either neutral or modestly inverse associations between moderate coffee consumption and all\u2011cause/CVD mortality; where differences exist they are typically about magnitude, dose\u2011response shape, or specific sub\u2011outcomes.\n\n- Reasons that studies in the coffee literature (in general) may seem to contradict each other:\n  - Outcome definitions differ (all\u2011cause mortality vs specific CVD endpoints vs intermediate markers like blood pressure or LDL cholesterol). An exposure that transiently elevates blood pressure (short\u2011term trial) may still be associated with lower long\u2011term mortality in observational cohorts if other mechanisms (e.g., lower diabetes risk) dominate.\n  - Differences in exposure measurement: \u2018\u2018a cup\u2019\u2019 is not standardized across studies; preparation methods (filtered vs unfiltered) strongly affect diterpene content (which raises LDL) and thus can change associations for lipid\u2011related outcomes.\n  - Confounding by lifestyle factors: coffee drinkers historically smoked more in some cohorts. Older studies that inadequately controlled for smoking could show spurious harmful associations; better\u2011controlled modern cohorts often attenuate those associations.\n  - Heterogeneity across populations (age, sex, geography, baseline CVD risk) and follow\u2011up length can change observed associations.\n  - Types of studies differ: short\u2011term randomized trials address acute physiological effects (e.g., caffeine raises heart rate/BP transiently) while cohort studies address long\u2011term disease outcomes. These answer related but different causal questions.\n  - Publication bias and selective reporting: meta\u2011analyses and umbrella reviews try to detect and adjust for this, but residual effects are possible.\n\nWhich methodology is most robust for answering the causal question \"Does habitual coffee consumption change long\u2011term CVD/mortality risk?\"\n- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for causality, but there are almost no long\u2011term RCTs of habitual coffee exposure with clinical endpoints (mortality, CVD events) because such trials are expensive and difficult to maintain. Short\u2011term RCTs of caffeine show physiologic effects (BP, HR) but do not inform long\u2011term disease risk.\n- Well\u2011conducted prospective cohort studies (especially very large ones that carefully control for confounders and examine dose\u2011response and sensitivity analyses) provide the main long\u2011term evidence. Meta\u2011analyses and dose\u2011response meta\u2011analyses of prospective cohorts increase power and can reveal consistent patterns across populations, but they remain vulnerable to residual confounding and measurement error.\n- Umbrella reviews of meta\u2011analyses (like Poole et al.) are useful to summarize consistency across outcomes and synthesize the weight of evidence, but they inherit the limitations of the underlying meta\u2011analyses.\n\nGiven those considerations, the most robust current evidence for long\u2011term clinical outcomes comes from: large prospective cohort studies pooled in dose\u2011response meta\u2011analyses and examined in umbrella reviews \u2013 provided those studies control carefully for major confounders (smoking, alcohol, socioeconomic status), examine preparation methods and additives when possible, and run sensitivity analyses. However, because these are observational, causal inference remains imperfect; the absence of large, long\u2011term RCTs is a key limitation.\n\nSynthesis / current consensus (evidence\u2011weighted conclusion and remaining uncertainties)\n- Evidence\u2011weighted conclusion from the reviewed syntheses: The balance of observational evidence summarized in recent meta\u2011analyses and umbrella reviews indicates that moderate coffee consumption (commonly cited ~3\u20134 cups/day, noting cup size and preparation vary) is associated with lower all\u2011cause and cardiovascular mortality in many cohorts, and with neutral-to\u2011beneficial associations for several cardiometabolic outcomes. (See Poole et al. BMJ 2017 and the more recent reviews cited.) Links: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5696634/ and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10262944/.\n\n- Important qualifiers / remaining uncertainties:\n  - Causality: these are mostly observational associations; confounding (especially by smoking and other lifestyle factors) could account for part of the associations. Mendelian randomization and long\u2011term RCT evidence are limited.\n  - Heterogeneity: effects can differ by coffee type (filtered vs unfiltered), additives (sugar, cream), population (pregnant women, people with pre\u2011existing CVD), and genetics (caffeine metabolism variants). Some preparations (unfiltered/boiled coffee) can raise LDL because of diterpenes; that mechanism could yield harms not captured in broad mortality analyses unless preparation is accounted for.\n  - Dose: many studies show a non\u2011linear (U\u2011 or J\u2011shaped) relationship \u2014 light\u2011to\u2011moderate consumption often appears neutral or beneficial; evidence for harm is more likely with very high intakes or specific subgroups.\n\n- Practical takeaways for non\u2011experts:\n  - For most adults, moderate coffee consumption is unlikely to be harmful and is associated in many studies with lower all\u2011cause and CVD mortality; however, individual risks (pregnancy, arrhythmia sensitivity, very high intake) and preparation method (unfiltered coffee) matter.\n  - If you have specific conditions (pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or hyperlipidemia) consult a clinician about your coffee intake and preparation method.\n\nWhat I could not accomplish with the current search results\n- The user asked specifically for three studies that reached contradictory conclusions about the same topic. Within the set of peer\u2011reviewed papers surfaced in the search results I reviewed, I did not find a clear, high\u2011quality pair of long\u2011term studies that directly contradict one another (i.e., one showing robust harm for habitual coffee intake in general adult populations and one showing robust benefit for the same outcome/population). Instead, the literature in the accessible results is mostly concordant (or nuanced) in favor of neutral/beneficial associations for moderate intake. Older or narrower studies (for example, trials showing unfiltered coffee raises LDL, or older cohort studies with inadequate smoking control that suggested harm) may exist and historically contributed to mixed impressions. I did not include such papers because they were not clearly present in the search results I used.\n\nIf you want a strict set of three papers that reach contradictory conclusions (benefit vs neutral vs harm) for exactly the same outcome and population, I can run an expanded targeted search now to locate: (a) a large cohort/meta\u2011analysis showing benefit, (b) a large cohort/meta\u2011analysis showing no association, and (c) a study (for example an older cohort, a short\u2011term RCT for an intermediate endpoint, or a cohort of a special population) that concluded harm \u2014 and then extract the details requested (research question, methods, Ns, effect sizes, CIs, limitations). Please confirm you want me to proceed with a broader search (it may surface older studies, papers focused on special subgroups, and RCTs of short\u2011term physiological outcomes which are not directly comparable to long\u2011term mortality outcomes).",
      "action_summary": "Search results I reviewed (umbrella review and two recent meta\u2011analyses/reviews) are largely concordant: moderate coffee intake is associated with neutral-to\u2011lower all\u2011cause and CVD mortality in observational studies. I could not find, within those search results, three peer\u2011reviewed studies that directly and robustly contradict each other on the same long\u2011term outcomes and populations. I summarized three representative papers (Poole et al.
