However, I currently do not have the ability to perform external web searches or fetch documents from the Internet in this session. Because your mandate requires using only evidence from searches/visits and including inline URL citations, I cannot produce the requested cited narrative right now.\n\nIf you want me to proceed, please choose one of the following options:\n1) Allow me to perform live web searches and retrieve sources now (I will then gather primary sources such as the 1953 scientific analyses, contemporary accounts, museum records, later forensic studies, and relevant review papers and produce the requested narrative with inline URL citations). \n2) Provide the source documents or URLs you want me to use (PDFs, links to the key papers, or a bibliography), and I will synthesize the narrative strictly from those documents and include the inline citations you provide. \n3) If you prefer, I can produce an uncited, general-summary narrative based on my built-in knowledge (I will explicitly mark it as not based on newly fetched documents and will not supply URL citations).\n\nWhich option do you want?",
