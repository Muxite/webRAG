I must not guess exact repository counts or percentage changes. To proceed I need one of the following: (A) permission to fetch current web sources (State of the Octoverse / GitHub reports, GitHub REST API queries, or reputable aggregator pages) so I can retrieve exact repo counts for 2023 and 2024 and then compute percentage changes and produce the full analysis with citations; or (B) you can upload or paste the exact repository counts by language for 2023 and 2024 (or a link to a single authoritative page that lists them).\n\nIf you choose option A (allow web retrieval), I will gather authoritative sources (for example: GitHub\u2019s State of the Octoverse 2024, GitHub language statistics pages, or a reputable third-party aggregator), extract the top 5 languages with exact repo counts for 2023 and 2024, compute percentage changes (showing arithmetic), identify the language with largest percentage growth, list primary use cases for each language (with citations), analyze trends (community, corporate adoption, tooling, surveys) and give a reasoned prediction about whether any language might overtake the current leader in the next 2 years \u2014 all with inline URL citations.\n\nIf you provide the data directly (option B), I will compute the percentage changes, identify the largest growth, attach concise primary-use descriptions (sourced to authoritative references if you want), analyze trends, and make the 2-year overtaking prediction.\n\nNote: I cannot reliably produce the exact repository counts or percentage changes without those external sources; per your instruction I will not guess or invent numbers.",
