This is manufacturer content stating that a 140W Anker charger implements PD 3.1 (note: this product\u2019s maximum output is 140W, not the PD 3.1 maximum of 240W). \n  Source (Anker manufacturer page): https://www.anker.com/blogs/chargers/ubiquitous-charging-the-pd-charger-complete-guide\n\nNotes and evidence caveats:\n- The USB-IF page is the authoritative source that states PD Revision 3.1 and the 240 W / EPR changes (see https://www.usb.org/usb-charger-pd).\n- The added fixed voltages (28 V, 36 V, 48 V) and practical details are described in independent summaries and vendor app notes (Tom\u2019s Hardware and Renesas) that reference the PD 3.1 EPR additions (see links above).\n- A manufacturer (Anker) explicitly references a PD 3.1 product (their 140W 4-port charger) on Anker\u2019s site; this confirms commercial product support for the PD 3.1 specification. The merged search results do not include a direct product manual PDF from Anker in this set of results; the cited Anker blog is manufacturer-hosted documentation that names a PD 3.1 product (https://www.anker.com/blogs/chargers/ubiquitous-charging-the-pd-charger-complete-guide).
