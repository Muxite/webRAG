      "final_deliverable": "Result: I could not complete the requested ranked counts and percentage-change calculations because I could not retrieve the authoritative pages with exact GitHub repository counts for 2024 and 2023 from the web in this session. The search-step returned relevant candidate sources (listed below), but the attempts to visit those pages and extract numeric repo counts failed (HTTP fetch failed). I will not guess or fabricate numbers. Evidence available from the searches (not full pages) and next steps are below.\n\nWhat I attempted and what failed\n- I searched for authoritative sources that list GitHub repository counts by language for 2024 and 2023 (GitHub Octoverse, GitHut/madnight, OSS Insight, GH Archive/BigQuery analyses). Search results pointed to likely authoritative pages such as: madnight GitHut (https://madnight.github.io/githut/) and Githut (https://githut.info/) and OSS Insight (https://ossinsight.io/) and related analytics pages. These search results were found during the session but the follow-up page fetch/visit failed, so I do not have exact repository counts or 2023->2024 comparisons to cite from those pages. See search hits: madnight GitHut (https://madnight.github.io/githut/), Githut (https://githut.info/), OSS Insight (https://ossinsight.io/) and related analytics pages returned by the query.\n\nWhy I cannot provide the requested numbers now\n- Your request requires exact repository counts for 2024 and 2023 and computed percentage changes. The session produced only search-result metadata but the HTTP fetch step to load the pages and extract the numbers returned an error (HTTP fetch failed). Because of that I do not have verifiable numeric data to compute percent changes, determine which language had the largest percentage growth, or to identify the top-5 by exact repo count in 2024. Per your instruction I will not guess or invent figures.\n\nSuggested authoritative sources to obtain exact counts (I can fetch and extract if you approve)\n1) GitHut / madnight GitHut language stats (historical GitHub language share and repository counts): https://madnight.github.io/githut/ (shows language usage on GitHub by year/month). [search result found]\n2) Githut.info (alternative interface for GitHub language statistics): https://githut.info/ [search result found]\n3) OSS Insight / GH Archive / Google BigQuery analyses (event-level and repo-level stats): https://ossinsight.io/ and GH Archive datasets (use BigQuery) [search result found]\n4) GitHub Octoverse / official GitHub reports and blog posts (Octoverse sometimes contains language trends): https://github.blog (search Octoverse pages) [general reference]\n5) If available, GitHub REST API (search endpoint) can return repo counts per language for custom queries (note: API search rate limits apply).\n\nHow I will proceed once you permit page fetches\n- I will fetch the authoritative pages above (starting with madnight GitHut and OSS Insight/Octoverse) to extract verified repository counts for 2024 and 2023.\n- I will compute percentage change for each language using: percent change = (count_2024 - count_2023) / count_2023 * 100, and identify the largest growth.\n- For each top-5 language by 2024 repo count I will list: the exact repo count (2024), percent change vs 2023, primary use cases (with citations), and identify which language had the largest percentage growth (with citation to the numeric data source).\n- I will then analyze trends (ecosystem momentum, star/activity growth, hiring signals from Stack Overflow/RedMonk/TIOBE where relevant) using cited sources and provide a reasoned prediction whether any language could overtake the 2024 leader within two years.\n\nIf you want me to continue and fetch pages now\n- Reply \u201cProceed\u201d and I will fetch the authoritative pages and produce the full deliverable (top 5 by 2024 repo count, exact counts, percent changes vs 2023, primary use cases, largest growth, trend analysis, and prediction), citing each numeric source inline.\n\nIf you prefer to provide a specific dataset or URLs yourself\n- Paste the URLs (or dataset) containing the 2023 and 2024 repo counts and I will compute the percentage changes, produce the top-5 list, and provide the requested analysis and prediction with citations to those URLs.\n\nCited search-result leads (pages I found but could not fetch to extract numbers):\n- madnight GitHut \u2014 GitHub Language Stats: https://madnight.github.io/githut/ (search result)\n- GitHut \u2014 Programming Languages and GitHub: https://githut.info/ (search result)\n- OSS Insight / open-source highlights: https://ossinsight.io/ (search result)\n- GitHub docs: About repository languages: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-repository-languages (search result)\n- Additional analytics pages that appeared in search results: https://vladrachev.com/notes/2024/repo-analysis/, https://www.inclind.com/news/github-statistics-trends (search results)\n\nSummary of the deliverable status\n- I could not produce the requested ranked top-5 with exact counts and percent-change figures because page fetches to extract the authoritative numeric data failed. I will fetch and compute the full answer with citations if you authorize me to fetch those pages now, or you can provide the exact 2023/2024 counts and I will compute and analyze them.\n",
