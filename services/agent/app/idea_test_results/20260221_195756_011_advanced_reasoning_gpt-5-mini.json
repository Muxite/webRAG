      "final_deliverable": "Below I summarize three published papers/reviews that reached different conclusions about coffee and health (particularly all\u2011cause or cardiovascular mortality/CVD risk), extract the available methodological details from the retrieved sources, then analyze why their conclusions differ and which methods are most robust. I use only the retrieved sources below and explicitly note where details were not available in those retrievals.\n\n1) Poole et al., 2017 \u2014 umbrella review (conclusion: overall protective / inverse association)\n- Citation / link: Poole R, Kennedy OJ, Roderick P, Fallowfield JA, Hayes PC, Parkes J. Coffee consumption and health: umbrella review of meta-analyses of multiple health outcomes. BMJ. 2017;359:j5024. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/ (DOI given on the paper page)\n- Research question: What is the direction and strength of association between coffee consumption and a wide range of health outcomes (including all\u2011cause mortality)?\n- Methodology: Umbrella review \u2014 i.e., systematic review of existing meta\u2011analyses covering many health outcomes and cohort studies. The authors summarized pooled estimates from prior meta\u2011analyses and graded the evidence.\n- Sample size / population: The umbrella review synthesizes many meta\u2011analyses and therefore aggregates results from many cohort studies; an overall pooled number of participants is not provided as a single figure in the high\u2011level summary I retrieved. (Exact aggregate N not extracted from the retrieved pages.)\n- Key findings (from retrieved text): The umbrella review reported evidence of a non\u2011linear association between coffee consumption and several outcomes, and for all\u2011cause mortality it reported the largest relative risk reduction at intakes of about 3\u20134 cups/day versus none (summary relative risk ~0.83 compared with none; see paper) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/].\n- Potential limitations (as stated or implied in the paper): the underlying evidence is mostly observational (cohort) data, so residual confounding and bias are possible; heterogeneity across studies in exposure measurement (cup size, caffeinated vs decaf, preparation) and across populations; inability of observational pooled data to prove causality.\n\n2) Grosso et al. / Ding et al. \u2014 systematic review / dose\u2013response meta\u2011analysis (conclusion: little or no association for some CVD outcomes / mixed results) [retrieved paper that summarizes earlier conflicting evidence]\n- Citation / link: \u201cLong\u2011Term Coffee Consumption and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review and a Dose\u2011Response Meta\u2011Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies\u201d (full text available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/).\n- Research question: Is long\u2011term coffee consumption associated with risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes (CHD, stroke, heart failure, etc.)?\n- Methodology: Systematic review and dose\u2011response meta\u2011analysis of prospective cohort studies (authors extracted prospective cohort data and combined estimates across studies to evaluate dose\u2013response relationships).\n- Sample size / population: The paper pooled multiple prospective cohort studies; the retrieved summary does not list one single aggregate N in the snippet I retrieved. (Exact pooled sample size not extracted from the retrieved pages.)\n- Key findings (from retrieved text): The paper noted that many earlier case\u2011control studies (1980s\u20132000s) tended to show positive associations between coffee and CHD, whereas meta\u2011analyses of prospective cohort studies tended to find no association (although results varied by outcome and across studies). It also discussed preparation differences (boiled/unfiltered coffee raises cholesterol in trials) and outcome\u2011specific heterogeneity [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n- Potential limitations: heterogeneity across studies in coffee measurement, preparation, and confounder adjustment; reliance on observational cohort data (possibility of residual confounding); differences in outcome definitions across cohorts.\n\n3) Example of earlier (case\u2013control) studies / older trials reporting harmful effects (conclusion: positive / harmful association in some studies or trials)\n- Citation / link: The systematic review above and other reviews note that earlier case\u2013control studies often reported positive associations between higher coffee intake and coronary heart disease; the same review cites a randomized trial showing that boiled (unfiltered) coffee increases serum cholesterol (discussion in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/). See also the review that summarizes conflicting results: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835155/.\n- Research question (typical for these older studies): Is greater coffee intake associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease?\n- Methodology (typical): Many were case\u2013control studies (retrospective comparison of intake between cases and controls), and some short\u2011term randomized feeding trials examining biochemical outcomes (e.g., serum cholesterol after boiled/unfiltered coffee).\n- Sample size / population: Individual older case\u2013control studies vary widely in size; the retrieved reviews summarize many such studies rather than reporting a single sample size. (Exact N for specific older case\u2013control papers not reported in the retrieved summary.)\n- Key findings (as summarized by the reviews): Several older case\u2011control studies reported positive associations between higher coffee consumption and CHD risk; randomized feeding trials showed that boiled/unfiltered coffee can raise serum cholesterol (a plausible mechanistic pathway increasing CVD risk) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835155/].\n- Potential limitations: case\u2013control studies are prone to recall and selection bias and confounding (esp. by smoking); short randomized trials measured intermediate biomarkers (cholesterol) over short intervals and did not measure long\u2011term clinical endpoints (CVD events or mortality).\n\nWhy the conclusions differ \u2014 analysis using only the retrieved evidence\n- Study design differences: The retrieved sources emphasize that older case\u2013control studies often found harmful associations, whereas prospective cohort studies and meta\u2011analyses of cohort data generally found null or inverse associations. Case\u2013control studies are more vulnerable to recall and selection bias; prospective cohorts reduce some of those biases. Umbrella reviews/meta\u2011analyses integrate many cohort studies and often report an inverse association (e.g., Poole et al. BMJ 2017) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n- Confounding (especially by smoking): The reviews discuss that smoking has historically confounded coffee\u2013CVD associations (coffee drinkers were more likely to be smokers in many cohorts); inadequate control for smoking and other lifestyle factors in some studies could produce spurious positive associations in older studies [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n- Exposure measurement and coffee type / preparation: The reviews point out that studies differ in how they measure coffee (cups/day, serving size), whether coffee is caffeinated or decaf, and how it\u2019s prepared (filtered vs boiled/unfiltered). Boiled/unfiltered coffee contains diterpenes that raise cholesterol in short\u2011term trials \u2014 a mechanism that could explain higher CVD risk in some settings [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n- Outcome definitions and follow\u2011up: Different studies targeted different outcomes (all\u2011cause mortality, CHD, stroke, heart failure) and had different follow\u2011up durations; pooled reviews report outcome\u2011specific differences.\n- Publication timing and study populations: Older studies with less rigorous adjustment and different baseline populations gave different signals than more recent large cohorts/meta\u2011analyses.\n\nWhich methodology is most robust (based on the retrieved evidence)\n- The retrieved sources emphasize that prospective cohort studies with careful confounder adjustment, dose\u2013response meta\u2011analyses pooling many cohorts, and umbrella reviews summarizing multiple meta\u2011analyses provide stronger, more reliable observational evidence than single small case\u2013control studies. The umbrella review (Poole et al., BMJ 2017) pooled high\u2011level evidence and graded consistency across outcomes and thus is methodologically strong among observational syntheses but still limited by the underlying observational data [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/].\n- Randomized controlled trials measuring long\u2011term clinical outcomes are lacking in the retrieved evidence; short\u2011term randomized feeding trials demonstrate plausible biological effects of some coffee preparations (e.g., boiled coffee raising serum cholesterol) but cannot by themselves establish effects on long\u2011term CVD events or mortality [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n- Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, which can help address confounding, are not prominent in the specific retrieved summaries; therefore they are not part of this evidence set presented here.\n\nSynthesis / current consensus (based on the retrieved reviews)\n- The best available synthesis in the retrieved material (umbrella review and systematic dose\u2013response meta\u2011analyses) indicates that moderate coffee consumption (roughly 3\u20134 cups/day in many analyses) is not associated with increased all\u2011cause mortality and is often associated with lower risks for several outcomes in observational data; however, some older studies and specific coffee preparations (boiled/unfiltered) are associated with adverse intermediate biochemical effects (higher cholesterol) and in some older studies with higher CHD risk [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n- Confidence and remaining uncertainty: Confidence in a small protective or neutral association for typical filtered/cup coffee is moderate from observational pooled data, but causality is not proven because randomized trials of clinical outcomes are absent and residual confounding (especially by smoking and lifestyle) remains a plausible alternative explanation. The potential harmful effect of unfiltered/boiled coffee on serum lipids is supported by randomized feeding trials but the translation to long\u2011term CVD risk depends on dose/preparation and long\u2011term data [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n\nPractical takeaway (evidence\u2011based, from the retrieved sources)\n- For general populations, moderate coffee intake (e.g., roughly 3\u20134 cups/day) is not clearly harmful and is often associated with neutral or lower mortality in pooled observational studies; people with specific lipid concerns might prefer filtered coffee because some kinds of unfiltered/boiled coffee raise serum cholesterol in trials. However, because much of the evidence is observational, firm causal statements cannot be made from the retrieved material alone [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/].\n\nNotes on limits of this summary and missing data\n- I used only the documents retrieved in the searches and reviews cited above. The retrieved review papers synthesize many original studies; they summarize aggregate results but the specific sample sizes and effect estimates for each original study were not extracted into the retrieval summary I used here. Where an exact pooled N, exact hazard ratio and exact 95% CI for a particular cohort was not present in the retrieved excerpt, I state that the exact number was not extracted rather than guessing. If you want, I can fetch the individual cohort papers (or the supplementary tables of the meta\u2011analyses) and extract exact sample sizes, effect estimates, and CIs for three named original studies (one showing harm, one neutral, one protective) and provide more granular comparison.\n\nReferences (retrieved sources cited above)\n- Poole R, Kennedy OJ, Roderick P, Fallowfield JA, Hayes PC, Parkes J.

      "action_summary": "I identified three retrieved review papers that summarize differing conclusions about coffee and health: (1) an umbrella review (Poole et al., BMJ 2017) that found an overall inverse association between moderate coffee intake and all\u2011cause mortality (largest benefit ~3\u20134 cups/day) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/]; (2) a dose\u2013response meta\u2011analysis of prospective cohorts that reported mixed findings and noted that prospective cohorts often show no association while older case\u2011control studies tended to show positive (harmful) associations, and that boiled/unfiltered coffee raises serum cholesterol in trials [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945962/]; and (3) reviews summarizing older case\u2013control studies and short randomized feeding trials that reported harmful associations or adverse lipid effects for unfiltered coffee [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835155/]. Differences in design (case\u2013control vs prospective cohort vs meta\u2011analysis), confounding (esp. smoking), exposure measurement (cups, preparation), and outcome definitions explain the discordant conclusions. The most robust evidence from the retrieved material is pooled prospective cohort data and umbrella/meta\u2011analyses, which point to neutral or modestly inverse associations for typical filtered coffee, but causality remains uncertain and unfiltered/boiled coffee can raise cholesterol in randomized trials. Exact sample sizes and numeric effect estimates for individual original studies were not extracted from the retrieved summaries; I can fetch those individual papers and report precise numbers on request.",
