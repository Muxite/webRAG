Because of that, I am explicitly not guessing or fabricating comments or user backgrounds.\n\nNext steps I can take if you want me to proceed:\n- Try again to visit those Reddit threads (if you allow another fetch attempt). Provide any specific thread URL you want me to extract comments from.\n- If you (or I) provide the text or screenshots of the social-media comments, I can quote them, analyze apparent backgrounds, and summarize the discussion.\n\nIf you want me to re-run the fetch now, tell me which thread(s) to try first (or provide the thread URLs).",
