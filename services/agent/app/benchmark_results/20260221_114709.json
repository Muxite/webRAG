NOTE: I could not fetch the Intel advisory to quote its specific mitigation text.\n\nNotes on evidence and citations:\n- You requested exactly two citations from different domains (the CVE entry and Intel advisory). I attempted to collect those sources but could not retrieve or verify them in this session. Because I cannot access the authoritative pages now, I have not provided any external URLs or dates to avoid guessing. If you provide the CVE or Intel advisory URLs (or allow web access), I will extract the exact instruction name, the public disclosure date, the researcher and their paper/page, and add the two required citations and a concise one-sentence leak description.",
