# webRAG / Euglena — Session Handoff (2026-06-16)

Start here. This is the project-wide pickup doc; the deep benchmark log is
`services/agent/app/COST_BENCHMARK_HANDOFF.md` (Rounds 1–4).

## TL;DR — current state
Everything below is **committed and on `master` (origin @ `3ab4d82`)** — previously all uncommitted.
Six commits landed this session:
`da4b649` benchmark+DAG layer → `4ec260c` thin-leaf+price-aware vote → `2a622e0` Round-4 doc →
`09ece84` dev agents → `0e6b05b` Phase-1 deletions → `3ab4d82` god-class breakup.

## The thesis (proven)
A cheap model executing an **expensive-model-authored DAG scaffold** recovers premium-reference
accuracy at a fraction of the dollar cost — and beats the same cheap model *building* the graph
itself. Live cross-shape matrix (`run_id xshape_full_20260615_164736`, tasks 050–054, 4 cheap
models + reference, n=3):

- **gpt-4.1-nano B-auto: 0.96 @ $0.0016/task ≈ reference 0.97 @ $0.0655 (≈1/42 the cost).**
- Native cheap-built graph: ~0.33–0.46. Level-ladder (hard graph-level tasks): compiled **0.923**
  vs native graph **0.332** vs sequential 0.755 — compiled is also *cheaper* than the native graph.
- Artifact: `services/agent/idea_test_results/recovery_curve.png` (gitignored).

## Phase 2 — structured work makes weak models stronger (the active research line)
Pushing structure down to the leaf lifts cheap models toward the ceiling:
- **Atomic decomposition** (one fact / one page; chain cross-entity hops with `depends_on`+`{dep_id}`).
  Folding cross-*page* hops into one leaf *regressed* chains — don't.
- **Thin leaf** (`IDEA_TEST_COMPILED_LEAF_MODE=thin`): fixed `search → pick-wiki → visit → extract`
  micro-pipeline; harness owns control flow, LLM only answers micro-questions. Beats the JSON-ReAct
  leaf on weak models at ~half cost.
- **Price-aware anchored voting** (`_votes_for_model` via `model_costs`): cheap→k=5, gpt-5-mini→3,
  premium→1. k independent neutral-prompt extractions → majority prune → repeat-cycle to a 2nd page,
  anchored on the temp-0 read. Result: **nano avg 0.87→0.95** (051 chain 0.71→1.00); flash-lite
  ~0.95 (redundancy helps the *weaker* model more — the thesis).
- Default `LEAF_MODE` is still `react` (thin not yet tested on the premium reference).

## Architecture map (`services/agent/app/`)
- **Engine:** `idea_engine.py` (`IdeaDagEngine`, now 1327 lines after the Phase-3 breakup) + extracted
  modules it delegates to: `idea_chunking.py`, `idea_visit_dedup.py`, `idea_sequencing.py`.
- **Policies/config:** `idea_policies/*` — typed-config views in `config.py` (read `self._cfg.<view>.<field>`,
  never raw `settings.get()`), `actions.py` (2162-line multi-class action registry), schemas in
  `idea_dag_schemas.py`, defaults in `idea_dag_settings.json`.
- **Compiled scaffold:** `testing/compiled_plan.py` (DAG schema v2: leaves+depends_on+`{dep_id}`,
  topo waves), `testing/scaffold_compiler.py` (offline `compile_plan`, disk-cached by mandate hash),
  `testing/execution_compiled.py` (executor: react + thin + price-aware voting).
- **Other arms:** `testing/execution.py` (graph + parametric/naive_rag baselines),
  `execution_sequential.py` (sequential_react). **Runner:** `idea_test_runner.py`, `testing/runner.py`.
- **Tasks:** `idea_tests/test_*.py` — tiered ladder 048–054; **050–054 are the cross-shape set**
  (chain / dependent-chain / breadth-argmin / breadth-argmax / mixed-DAG).
- **Scripts:** `scripts/{compile_plans,cross_shape_experiment,gate_report,recovery_curve,level_ladder,prewarm_fixtures}.py`.
- **Dev agents:** `.claude/agents/*.md` (see below). Gitignored-but-tracked dir; rest of `.claude/` ignored.

## How to run (live = real $; see COST_BENCHMARK_HANDOFF.md for the full recipe)
```
# keys.env is CRLF — strip \r; chroma must be on :8001; PYTHONPATH needs BOTH roots
export PYTHONPATH=services:services/agent
export IDEA_TEST_CONCURRENCY=1 IDEA_TEST_PARALLEL_ACTION_LIMIT=1   # MANDATORY (shared connectors)
./.venv/bin/python -m agent.app.idea_test_runner   # driver: scripts/cross_shape_experiment.sh
```
Key knobs: `IDEA_TEST_{IDS,MODELS,EXECUTION_VARIANTS,RUNS,FIXTURES(record|replay),RUN_ID}`,
`IDEA_TEST_COMPILED_{PLAN_SOURCE(hand|auto),LEAF_MODE(react|thin),VOTES,CONCURRENCY,AUTHOR_MODEL}`.
Variants: `graph, sequential_react, graph_compiled, parametric, naive_rag`. Author plans offline first:
`scripts/compile_plans.py --tests 050,051,052,053,054 --max-tokens 4096` (052 needs 4096). Analyze by
run-id: `gate_report.py` / `level_ladder.py` / `recovery_curve.py`.

Offline tests (no $): `PYTHONPATH=services:services/agent ./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q <files>`.

## Dev agents (`.claude/agents/`) — load next session
Five consolidated Claude Code subagents: `task-author` (author+verify+harden a task),
`benchmark` (run live matrices, singleton/$ + analyze), `strategy-tuner` (the Phase-2 A/B loop),
`engine-dev` (engine/policy work), `reviewer` (pre-commit gate + git hygiene, no Claude trailer).
README frames Phase 1 (build the system) vs Phase 2 (improve cheap models). NOTE: custom agents only
register at session START — they were authored this session, so invoke them by name next time
(this session used `general-purpose` with the brief injected).

## Known debt / open items
1. ~~import-context test failures~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-16 (commit `4717ab8`): suite green —
   0 failed, 377 passed, 17 skipped.** The "import-context / cannot import name IdeaActionType"
   diagnosis was STALE. Actual root causes (17 failures, not 13): `idea_engine_features` ×5 = the
   god-class breakup moved mandate-URL enforcement into `MandateUrlInjectionHook`; restored a thin
   delegating `_enforce_visit_nodes_for_mandate_urls` on the engine (test surface). `got_backtrack`
   ×7 = test self-pollution (stub installer short-circuited when a sibling test imported the real
   `idea_memory` first → stubs now install conditionally, no reverse pollution). `visit_url_extraction`
   ×1 = stale assertion (VISIT uses `io.fetch_url`, not `io.visit`). `connectors_smoke` + `pre_deploy_sanity`
   = environment guards (missing LLM key / `supabase` deploy dep absent from lean venv). `task_definition_preflight_env`
   ×2 = test drift; MIN_CHARS aligned to config source-of-truth `2000` (test had a never-passing `20000`
   — **confirm whether 20000 was the real deploy intent**, else this is settled).
2. **054 (mixed-DAG) nano ≈ 0.75** — a genuine task-difficulty floor, not a strategy artifact.
3. **Thin+vote untested on the premium reference** — test before making `thin` the default.
4. **Per-cheap-model B-hand was lost** in the Round-3 run (driver run-id collision; driver now fixed
   with `${RUN_ID}_auto`). A small C1-only rerun recovers it.
5. **God-class breakup is partial** — action execution (`_execute_action`/`_handle_action_result`)
   and node `_handle_*` orchestration remain in `idea_engine.py` (stateful; do carefully next).
6. Optional: fold legacy `EvaluationWeights` into `EvaluationConfig` (small dup).

## Recommended next order
(1) ✅ green the suite [debt #1 — done 2026-06-16, commit `4717ab8`] → (2) reference test of
thin+vote [#3] → (3) recover B-hand [#4] → (4) push on 054 [#2] →
(5) continue the engine breakup [#5].
